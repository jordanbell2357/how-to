# Comparing to sources of truth

We now have to compare our estimates for monthly port visits with sources of truth. The two parameters for measuring continuous visits to a port are radius of port and minimum time spent within that radius.

After comparing to sources of truth, there is next a cycle of adjusting parameters and comparing results to sources of truth.
